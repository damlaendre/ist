### Water

The tap water in Istanbul is unfortunately not safe to drink. Please buy bottled water from the supermarkets instead. If you want sparkling water, we don’t really have a European version. But you can find a stronger carbonated mineral water called soda in small (green) glass bottles. We suggest the brand “Beypazari”. They also have fruit flavoured versions.

### Thrash

Recycling is not really a thing here... Do not go mad trying to separate your trash in the hotel/Airbnb.
Very few glass bottles have a deposit that you can get back by taking it to a designated kiosk/Tekel (like a Spati).

### Mobile Phones

Turkey is not within the EU roaming scheme unfortunately. However, you can easily buy a package for your trip. Moreover, even at the airport you can easily get a prepaid simcard. WiFi is common, but you cannot fully depend on it to navigate yourself around the city, especially if you will use the public transportation application for the tickets.

### Calling Landline Phones

Istanbul stands on two continents. This is why there are two area codes. For the Anatolian side, it’s 0216, and for the European side, it’s 0212. When calling a landline from your phone, you need to know the area codes. This applies to everywhere else in Turkey. For mobile phones, Turkish numbers start with a "+90". If you want to call a landline number in a different city, you need to make sure to know the area code first. For example, Ankara is 0312.

### Money

Turkey uses Turkish Lira as its currency and while you can withdraw money from any bank or exchange office, many things including many taxis and the application for the public transportation accept credit cards.

### Safety

Istanbul is mostly quite safe. However as a metropolis of about 18 million people, it has also seen terror attacks. This means you should beware of pickpockets and when/where you walk at night time. Do not leave your things unattended. In case you are in a crowded space and there is some sort of commotion, a loud bang, etc. make sure you have a safe distance from it. Usually, Istiklal Street, Taksim and big shopping malls are where we are the most cautious about these things. It's also the reason why shopping malls and airports have extra security and xray machines at the entrance.

Also, if a shoe shiner drops their brushes in front of you, please do not pick it up.

### Natural Disasters

When it rains, floods are quite frequent, but it is not really a thing to be afraid of. You won't be able to find a single taxi though, so enjoy the rain.

Istanbul is however an earthquake zone. The chances of a big earthquake (above 7.0) is above 64% before 2030 ([source](https://www.duvarenglish.com/istanbul-to-be-hit-by-major-quake-in-next-7-years-with-64-chance-kandilli-observatory-professor-warns-news-61894)). As a result, although we don’t have much faith in our buildings, general infrastructure, or the state, we all have mental escape plans in case of emergency. We suggest you also be aware of your surroundings and learn how to protect yourselves in case of a tremor. Make sure your phone never runs out of battery and have a small earthquake bag ready with water, food, prescription medication, powerbank, flashlight, and do on. It does not hurt to be prepared.

### Sightseeing

We strongly suggest you to explore the city!

While Uskudar, where the wedding venue is, is an easily accessible point to travel to the European site, it is not as lively or secular/liberal as Kadikoy or Moda for instance. So you might consider not staying in that area for the entire duration of your stay. 

The European side has most of the historical landmarks, whereas from the Anatolian side you can easily access Prince's Islands to go for a swim or a historical hike.

Bear in mind that August is an extremely warm and humid period in Istanbul.
