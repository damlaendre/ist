            - "We have a deal with the hotel until the end of April 2024, 15 rooms are reserved for us at a discounted price of 170 Euros (two people room) + 45 Euro per any extra person in the same room. Those who want to book a room should contact Mrs. Hasret at this number on WhatsApp +90 542 229 88 99. If the 15 rooms fill very fast, the hotel is flexible in extending the discounted rate for other rooms for our guests. We suggest you to make your room booking as soon as possible so we can negotiate further discounts for the rest of the rooms."
            - "The rooms vary in size, so while there are single/double ones, bigger ones can accommodate up to 4 people. Some rooms have a circular bed, others have a normal shaped bed, some room have a jacuzzi inside. All rooms have a Bosphorus view."
            - "If you wish to stay elsewhere, there are a few serviced apartments around the venue, as well as other hotels in the area. Unfortunately, Booking.com does not work anymore in Turkey and you should look for local alternatives for it."
            - "We strongly advice to stay in an area close to the wedding venue on the night of the wedding. Because you never know how the traffic might be in terms of arriving on time, or how the taxi situation would be in the evening without getting scammed."

            - "You should therefore wear fancy party clothes of any color, but avoid white, off-white, full beige, or anything that is too white."
            - "Other than that, guests can wear whatever they desire without worrying about outshining the couple."
            - "Clothing that is too revealing is also culturally not appropriate."
            - "Otherwise, you can definitely rock a dress with a train and high heels (like the picture on the right)."

            - "In Turkey, the traditional wedding gift is a gold coin (see the picture on the right)."
            - "Traditionally, you either pin it onto the couple or give it to the person helping them collect the wedding gifts. If you choose to do this, you can go to any jeweler and ask for a quarter (the smallest) or something bigger, depending on your budget."
            - "If you choose not to pin it on us, you should write your name on a piece of paper and add it to the tiny sack that you put the coin in when giving it to us, so we can send you a thank you note."
            - "If you come last minute or have no motivation to navigate the Turkish gold industry, foreign currency cash (Euro or US Dollar usually) is always a good gift as well. You can also pin the banknotes onto the dresses, but we would prefer if you gave such gifts in an envelope instead."
            - "Compiling a wishlist or registry is not really a thing we do in Turkey, since couples usually gather their first homes together with the help of their families or their own funds before the wedding."
