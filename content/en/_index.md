            - "We have a deal with the hotel until the end of April 2024, 15 rooms are reserved for us at a discounted price of 170 Euros (two people room) + 45 Euro per any extra person in the same room. Those who want to book a room should contact Mrs. Hasret at this number on WhatsApp +90 542 229 88 99. If the 15 rooms fill very fast, the hotel is flexible in extending the discounted rate for other rooms for our guests. We suggest you to make your room booking as soon as possible so we can negotiate further discounts for the rest of the rooms."
            - "The rooms vary in size, so while there are single/double ones, bigger ones can accommodate up to 4 people. Some rooms have a circular bed, others have a normal shaped bed, some room have a jacuzzi inside. All rooms have a Bosphorus view."
            - "If you wish to stay elsewhere, there are a few serviced apartments around the venue, as well as other hotels in the area. Unfortunately, Booking.com does not work anymore in Turkey and you should look for local alternatives for it."
            - "We strongly advice to stay in an area close to the wedding venue on the night of the wedding. Because you never know how the traffic might be in terms of arriving on time, or how the taxi situation would be in the evening without getting scammed."
