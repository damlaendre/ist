## ‚úàÔ∏è Flying to Istanbul

Istanbul has two airports. The one on the Anatalion side is Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW) and it is the closest one to the venue. We strongly suggest you use this airport instead of the other. There is a direct subway from the airport to the hotel (or many places on the Anatolian side in general) for those who will be staying there. Reaching the hotel from Kadikoy (the Anatolian side's central point) is also possible by subway. If you choose to stay on the European side, you can‚Äôt use the subway only, but you need to take the Marmaray that ultimately also goes under the water.

The second, much further away airport is the Istanbul Airport (IST), from which there is no direct public transportation to the city.
The airport is also 3 hours away from "central" Istanbul. Still there are airport shuttles to central locations from this airport as well.

Merve has prepared the attached pdf to help you navigate the trip from Istanbul Airport or from the Sabiha G√∂kcen airport to √úsk√ºdar. You can [download it here](/ist/media/transport_to_Uskudar.pdf)

## Getting around in Istanbul

One needs an Istanbulkart to use the public transportation. This you can get from the machines at the airport. You can then connect it to the application on your phone and connect it to your credit card as well. If you choose, you can also put money into your card from the machines at the entrance/exit of subway stations, ferries/motoboats, and metrobuses. They can be used on almost every public transportation vehicle, excluding the Dolmu≈ü - Minibuses.

When using the subways or metrobuses, you should ask for a refund of your travel ticket if you don't travel the entire length of the line, before you exit the station. However, for those without a personalised Istanbulkart for travel, the fee for a single journey is always calculated at the maximum. This means that they charge you as if you have used the entire line from one end to another. If you personalise your card, you can get some refund at the end of your trip, to do so you should tap your card to the refund machines. Those without a Turkish ID number can unfortunately not personalise their cards, but a Turkish citizen can own up to 4 cards under their name, so you might want to make new friends to ask about this too!

**!!! Most public transportation stop around midnight in Istanbul!!!
Yes, we know it is crazy...**

## üöÜ Subway (Metro)

### Marmaray

We have a speacial subway line that connects both continents through a train tunnel that goes under the sea. If you choose to stay on the European side, you need to take this one to reach the venue. Marmaray also connects to the subway lines very smoothly and cover a large area. It is Damla's favourite means of transportation after the ferry/motorboat in Istanbul.

## üöå Buses / Metrobuses

You can use your Istanbulkart for the busses too but be aware that you can not top up your card on the bus. If you get on and your card screams that you do not have enough money on it, your only option is to try and ask someone to lend you their card and you pay them in cash. With the personalisation requirement for the Istanbulkart, doing so would cause the other person to be rejected or be understood as a transfer and might be problematic for them in the future so they would be more inclined to refuse this favour. So make sure you have enough money on your card before getting on a bus.
Metrobuses are also buses, that are slightly larger in size and they have their own lane to cross over the Bosphorus through the bridges.

### Dolmu≈ü - Minibuses

Dolmu≈ü is the big yellow taxi looking minibus that is peculiar to Istanbul. You don't need a ticket for it in advance. Once you are in, you tell the driver where you want to get off, and they tell you the price. If you can't directly give the money to the driver, you need to ask for the people in front of you to pass around your money. It's normal, don't worry. You just need to yell where you want to get off or ask the driver to tell you where you need to get off to get to where you wanted to go. Needless to say this is all a very Turkish experience and an expert tourist challenge.

## Ferries/Motor(boat)s

Best way to explore the Bosphorus is by taking a ferry or a motorboat to cross from one side to another. It is also the perfect way to travel in the summer! You can use your Istanbulkart for them.

## üöó Car rentals 

Driving in Istanbul is not something we suggest. If you still intend to drive, you need to know that parking is most often not free and you need to pay the people in uniforms before you leave. There are not really meters that you can make the payment. But as long as you find the responsible person, you might even be able to pay with a credit card. The hotel where the wedding will be also has a car parking service, which costs 100 TRY per car, to be paid in cash upon getting back the car.

## üöï Taxis

Using taxis in Istanbul is very problematic, even for the locals. We suggest you avoid taking taxis and use public transportation as much as you can. Taxis are known to ask to be paid in Euros, ask for overinflated rates from tourists and refuse to drive the locals. 

Should you decide to use a taxi, use only the official ones. They are yellow and have the license plates written around them. They should also have a small plaque in the taxi with the license plate and other indications on their legality. If you encounter an issue with the taxis you have the right to file an official complaint and even enclose a video/photo of the situation.

The application to call a taxi is called BiTaksi, and upon registration, it also works with non-Turkish phone numbers. It is usually the safest way to get a taxi, but the drivers still might not choose to pick you up if you are trying to go for a very short distance. If you are asked to pay more than what the app tells you, refuse to do so and consider calling the police (155). Due to the protests by the taxi drivers, there is no Uber or Bolt available in Turkey. It is possible to use Uber plus for airport transfers et al. Note that Istanbul is mostly very well connected with trains, despite the long distances.
