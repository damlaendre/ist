### ✈️ Flying to Romania

We recommend checking the flights to Bucharest, Sibiu, Târgu Mureș, Bacău, and Cluj-Napoca as the airports closest to the city. From the three Cluj-Napoca is the furthest away. Bucharest is generally the most well-connected with public transportation.

### Getting around in Romania

#### 🚆 Trains

Most of the trains are run by the state-owned company CFR. You find the schedule of the trains on the website: https://www.infofer.ro/. On-line tickets often need to be bought a day in advance, otherwise you need to buy them at the train stations. The schedule is also on the website https://www.infofer.ro/. 

A minority of trains is operated by private companies. The most important of these is Regio Călători. You find the schedule of the trains on the website: https://regiocalatori.ro/mersul-trenurilor/#/cautare/ Tickets can also be bought at some of the train station: https://regiocalatori.ro/mersul-trenurilor/program-case-de-bilete/ This might especially be relevant for the Bucharest-Brașov route, in case you are flying on/ out of Bucharest. 

#### 🚌 (Mini) buses 

Inter-city mini buses are a good alternative to trains. You find the schedule of minibuses on the website: https://www.autogari.ro/. 

Some companies also run airport shuttle services for instance from Bucharest. The schedule for these is on the same website. It might make sense to call/ book them in advance. At the Otopeni airport they leave from the ground floor of parking garage, opposite the building. You need to check whether you can book the shuttle to Sepsiszentgyörgy or to Brașov. In the latter case, there are other minibuses in every half an hour to Sepsiszentgyörgy from the Brașov train tation. 

#### 🚗 Car rentals 

The main car rental agencies are all present in Romania, usually at the airports, but not only. One local alternative is: https://www.westtaxi.ro/en/ You can also use this company to book a private airport transfer.

#### 🚕 Taxis

Please be aware that you can only pay in cash, in Romanian lei for the taxis. Some of the taxi numbers in Sepsiszentgyörgy are: [+40740439999](call:+40740439999); [+40723484060](call:+40723484060); [+40744839707](call:+40744839707); [+40722271903](call:+40722271903).
